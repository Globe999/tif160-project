# Hubert, the sorting robot

This is a project made in the course TIF160 at Chalmers, Humanoid Robotics. The robot is controlled by an Arduino which implements a bridge through serial communication to a Python interface and GUI. The robot can pick up objects of different colors and shapes and place them at predefined positions on a table according to prompts made by the user.
